#![deny(unsafe_code)]
//! Utilities for describing equalities between types.
//!
//! An important requirement of the `party` core API is _low-cost
//! abstraction_; that is, making your code generic over a
//! [`crate::PartySystem`] should not incur any surprise memory or
//! runtime costs.
//!
//! The realities of making this happen are, given certain
//! 'limitations' of the Rust type system, somewhat complicated in
//! general -- ideally, we need to convince the type system that
//! the compiler-generated concretions of party-generic code have
//! types that are _actually equal_ to the 'thing' on the inside for
//! the given party.
//! This 'convincing' cannot be completely hidden; we need to, in
//! some cases, use an explicit encoding of the logic of type equality
//! (that is sound, consistent, and built on type equalities that Rust
//! can typically understand automatically).
//!
//! This module defines this logic, ultimately providing a library
//! capable of reasoning about equalities between complex generic
//! types (with a respectable starting point of commonly-used standard
//! library data structures like `Option` and `HashMap`) and defining
//! APIs with complex type equality type bounds.
//!
//! ## Type equality propositions
//!
//! As alluded to above, we occasionally need to reason about type
//! equalities explicitly so that our abstractions incur no
//! unnecessary runtime or memory costs (when Rust is unable to figure
//! out that equal types are equal without some help).
//!
//! To accomplish this, we use a trait, as this allows us to encode
//! the logic of type equality such that a type implementing the trait
//! encodes a concrete type equality proposition (that is either true
//! or false), _and_ we can safely `SUMMON` the evidence that a true
//! type equality is true for safe value-level manipulation of
//! propositions.
//! We 'seal' the trait [according to the Rust internal API
//! guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/future-proofing.html#sealed-traits-protect-against-downstream-implementations-c-sealed),
//! so that code using this module cannot introduce unsoundness or
//! inconsistency to the logic of type equalities that the trait
//! encapsulates.
//!
//! The trait `EqualityProposition<T0, T1>` encodes the logic of
//! statements of the form `T0 == T1`, which may be true or false.
//! A type `P: EqualityProposition<T0, T1>` is therefore a type-level
//! encoding of a _particular_ such statement -- furthermore, a
//! concrete value of such a type `P` is then _proof_ of the statement
//! encoded by `P`, by the Curry-Howard isomorphism.
//!
//! The logic of type equality is captured (and augmented with some
//! useful-for-our-purposes reasoning capabilities) by the
//! following statements:
//!
//! - `T1 == T0` (equality is symmetric)
//! - If (in addition to `T0 == T1`) `T1 == T2`, then `T0 == T2`
//!   (equality is transitive)
//! - `G<T0> == G<T1>` (type constructors are well-defined)
//! - Disjunctions with other `EqualityProposition`s of the same type
//!
//! The first two are required for type equality to be an equivalence
//! relation; reflexivity doesn't need to be explicitly encoded, as it
//! is indeed the case Rust can automatically handle in all cases (and
//! that we simply want to inherit from the type system to have its
//! soundness/consistency properties).
//! The latter two enhance the potential reasoning capability,
//! allowing for equality to be properly handled for any [`Generic`]
//! type (at least, any type implementing `Generic`; see [`generics`]
//! for a starting point for many common cases), and disjunctions
//! (which is particularly useful when using `EqualityProposition`s
//! and `Witness`es in enumerated types.
//!
//! Generics and disjunctions are somewhat more involved, so their
//! introduction is left to the documentation of those respective
//! types (see [`Generic`] and [`JoinedTypeEqualityWitness`]).
//!
//! But how do we know if an `EqualityProposition` is true or not?
//! And, knowing this, what can we _do_ with an `EqualityProposition`
//! that is useful?
//!
//! For the first question, `EqualityProposition` provides an
//! associated `const SUMMON: Option<Witness<Self>>` that is `Some(w)`
//! if and only if the `EqualityProposition` is actually true.
//! We will say more about `Witness<P>` shortly; for now, it suffices
//! to say that having a value of this type is how we _know_ that `P:
//! EqualityProposition` is true.
//!
//! For the second, the answer is simple: Casting!
//! A true type equality means that the types are truly and safely
//! interchangeable -- and, importantly, have the same representation
//! in memory.
//!
//! ## The concrete `EqualityProposition`s
//!
//! Before introducing `Witness`, recall that `EqualityProposition` is
//! a _sealed_ trait, meaning we provide the only types implementing
//! it.
//! There are, in fact, only two such types:
//!
//! - `TrueEqualityProposition`: Exactly what it says; this explicitly
//!   implements `EqualityProposition<T, T>`, which is the simplest
//!   type equality imaginable (at is known true by the reflexive
//!   property, and -- arguably more importantly -- the Rust compiler
//!   itself).
//! - `NotNecessarilyTrueEqualityProposition`: This is **in practice**
//!   always a _false_ equality proposition; it is given an obnoxious
//!   name because _we can't stop you from using this where the
//!   expected `EqualityProposition` is in fact true_.
//!   As everything defined here doesn't depend on having a concrete
//!   notion of a known-false equality proposition, this doesn't
//!   affect anything.
//!
//! A `TrueEqualityProposition`, as expected, is _always_ able to
//! `SUMMON` a witness; namely, the single value of type
//! `TrueEqualityProposition` (a `()`-like structure type).
//! (Note that we _actually_ summon a
//! `Witness<TrueEqualityProposition>` value, allowing for convenient
//! composition / reasoning with other `Witness`es at the value-level.
//! See below for more on `Witness`.)
//!
//! On the other hand, `NotNecessarilyTrueEqualityProposition` can
//! _never_ produce a witness, as it is an enumeration type with no
//! constructors.
//!
//! Each of these types implements `EqualityProposition`, but
//! naturally only `TrueEqualityProposition` can be `Witness`ed.
//!
//! ## `Witness`es
//!
//! So, finally, what is a `Witness<P>`?
//!
//! Summarizing what we have so far: If `P: EqualityProposition<T0,
//! T1>`, then `P` is a type-level encoding of the logical statement
//! `T0 == T1`.
//! Then, by the Curry-Howard isomorphism, values of type `P` are
//! _proof_ of the `EqualityProposition` described by `P`.
//!
//! Rust does not currently allow us to specify that trait methods are
//! `const`, and computations with the proofs of equality propositions
//! ought to be able to be simplified / computed with at compile-time.
//! For this reason, the wrapper type `Witness<P>` is introduced to
//! provide conveniences and the value-level equivalent of the
//! type-level interface defined by `EqualityProposition`, rather than
//! defining these methods on the `EqualityProposition` trait itself.
//!
//! For every associated type / "type-level function" in
//! `EqualityProposition`, there is a method (or methods)
//! corresponding to it defined for `Witness`.
//! (Disjunctions require _two_ methods: One to become the left
//! disjunct, and one to become the right.)
//!
//! Everything is tied together through the key property of
//! `EqualityProposition`: That `SUMMON` is `Some(w)` (where `w:
//! Witness<Self>`) if and only if the `EqualityProposition` is true.
//!
//! See the documentation of the types mentioned here for additional
//! detail regarding the practical use of these concepts; of
//! particular importance is [`Generic`], which is what us allows to
//! take our basic reasoning (which applies perfectly well to
//! primitive types out of the box) and allow its use over generic
//! types, exploiting the fact that type constructors are implicitly
//! well-defined.
