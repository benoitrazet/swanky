/// It's tailored to the specific use case of the VOLE-in-the-head paper[^vole], including
/// hardcoding some lengths and field sizes based on the [fixed parameters](crate::parameters)
/// and generally having an API that corresponds to the components and uses of
/// random VOLEs in Figure 7 of the paper, rather than the generic usage.
/// One notable difference is that the paper uses 1-indexing to refer to specific VOLE instances,
/// but this implementation uses 0-indexing.
///
/// ⚠️ Beyond the API limitations, this trait cannot be used in an arbitrary protocol that requires
/// a non-interactive VOLE. Specifically, the non-interactive decommitment step is equivalent to a
/// verifier revealing its choice bits (here, simulated using fiat-Shamir) to the prover; this
/// means that any protocol using this functionality must ensure that the verifier only obtains
/// their decommits at the end of the protocol, after the prover has completed all their operations
/// (see Baum et al.[^vole], Section 3.2 for more detail).
