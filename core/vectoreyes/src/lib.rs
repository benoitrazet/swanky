//! VectorEyes is a (almost entirely) safe and cross-platform wrapper library around vectorized
//! operations.
//!
//! While a normal `add` CPU instruction will add two numbers together, a
//! [SIMD/Vectorized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) `add`
//! instruction will perform multiple additions from the same instruction. This will amortize the
//! per-instruction cost (e.g. of the CPU decoding the instruction) across all the additions of the
//! single instruction. This can provide large speed boosts on many platforms.
//!
//! Unfortunately, using these operations require using per-platform unsafe intrinsics. To make
//! this easier, VectorEyes provide safe functions which will function identically on all
//! platforms.
//!
//! The core of this crate is vector types (such as [`U64x2`]). You can think of vectors as arrays
//! with some extra SIMD operations on top.
//!
//! Just like arrays vectors have an element type ([`u64`] in the example above), and an element
//! count, frequently referred to as _lanes_ (2 in the above example).
//!
//! In fact, you can freely convert between arrays and vectors!
//!
//! ```
//! # use vectoreyes::*;
//! // These two represent the same thing.
//! let vector_form = U64x2::from([123_u64, 456_u64]);
//! let array_form: [u64; 2] = vector_form.into();
//! ```
//!
//! However, the vector form has _special SIMD powers_! These two functions perform the same
//! operation, but the SIMD variant may[^may_be_faster] take better advantage of the CPU hardware.
//!
//! [^may_be_faster]: As always, only a Sith deals in absolutes. The Rust compiler can, in some
//! cases, employ _autovectorization_ to compile code which doesn't use SIMD operations into code
//! which uses SIMD instructions. Unfortunately, the compiler can't always autovectorize the way we
//! want it to, which is why VectorEyes exists!
//!
//! While normal _bog-standard_ arrays don't implement the `+` operator, our vector types do!
//! Adding two vectors together performs pairwise addition, using (for the vector backends) a
//! single CPU instruction!
//!
//! ```
//! # use vectoreyes::*;
//! fn double_without_simd(arr: [u64; 2]) -> [u64; 2] {
//!     [arr[0] + arr[0], arr[1] + arr[1]]
//! }
//! fn double_with_simd(arr: U64x2) -> U64x2 {
//!     arr + arr
//! }
//! assert_eq!(
//!     U64x2::from(double_without_simd([1, 2])),
//!     double_with_simd(U64x2::from([1, 2])),
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! The documentation for every method on a vector (e.g. [`I64x2::and_not`]) lists the equivalent
//! scalar code, as well as information on how the operation is implemented on each backend.
//!
//! # Vector Sizes
//! There aren't vector types for every conceivable `(type, element count)` pair. Instead, we have
//! vector types that correspond to the vector registers that many CPUs have. Because these
//! registers are 128- or 256-bits wide, we choose vector types which also have this size. For
//! example, there's a [`U64x2`] type and a [`U32x4`] type, since both are 128-bits wide. But
//! there's no `U32x2` type, because that'd only be 64-bits wide.
//!
//!
//! # Backends
//! VectorEyes chooses what backend to execute vector operations with at compile-time.
//!
//! ## AVX2
//! x86-64 CPUs that support the `AVX`, `AVX2`, `SSE4.1`, `AES`, `SSE4.2`, and
//! `PCLMULQDQ` features will use the `AVX2` backend.
//!
//! ## Neon
//! This is available on aarch64/arm64 machines with `neon` and `aes` features.
//!
//! ## Scalar
//! This is a fallback implementation that works on all CPUs. It's not
//! particularly performant.
//!
//! # Cargo Configuration
//! If using VectorEyes from the `swanky` repo, all this configuration has already been done for
//! you!
//! ## Native CPU Setup
//! Compile on the machine that you'll be running your code on, and add the
//! following to your `.cargo/config` file:
//! ```toml
//! [build]
//! rustflags = ["-C", "target-cpu=native", "--cfg=vectoreyes-target-cpu-native"]
//! rustdocflags = ["-C", "target-cpu=native", "--cfg=vectoreyes-target-cpu-native"]
//! ```
//! ## Specific CPU Selection
//! If you want to compile for some specific CPU, add the following to your
//! `.cargo/config` file:
//! ```toml
//! [build]
//! rustflags = ["-C", "target-cpu=TARGET", "--cfg=vectoreyes-target-cpu=\"TARGET\""]
//! rustdocflags = ["-C", "target-cpu=TARGET", "--cfg=vectoreyes-target-cpu=\"TARGET\""]
//! ```
//! ## Maximal Compatibility
//! If you do not put any of the above in your `.cargo/config` file,
//! `vectoreyes` will always use its `scalar` backend, which does not use vector
//! instructions.
//!
//! # Limitations
//! VectorEyes was designed around the AVX2 backend. For example, shuffle operations tend to be
//! constrained to 128-bit lanes because that's how the Intel intrinsics are constrained. As a
//! result, while code that uses VectorEyes might be optimal for an Intel platform, it might not be
//! optimal for an ARM platform with different intrinsics. (This is a limitation, generally, with
//! cross-platform SIMD libraries like VectorEyes.)
//!
//! In addition, many SIMD intrinsics are currently not wrapped in VectorEyes.
